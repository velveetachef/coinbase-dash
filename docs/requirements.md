## 🧪 Take-Home Programming Exercise: Crypto Dashboard

**Estimated Time:** 3–4 hours

**Tech Stack:** Remix + React

### 🎯 Objective

Build a simple, dynamic cryptocurrency dashboard using **Remix** and **React** that allows users to view, sort, and filter a list of cryptocurrencies. The dashboard should display real-time exchange rate data pulled from the **Coinbase API**.

### 📋 Requirements

### 1. **Cryptocurrency Card Layout**

- Display a list of at least **10 cryptocurrencies** (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) in a **responsive card-based layout**.
- Each card must include:
    - The cryptocurrency **name** and **symbol**
    - Current **exchange rate to USD**
    - Current **exchange rate to Bitcoin (BTC)**

### 2. **Dynamic Data Fetching**

- Use any suitable public endpoint to fetch **real-time exchange cryptocurrency exchange rates**.
- The rates should be updated **on page load**, and optionally allow for **manual refresh** or **auto-refresh**.

### 3. **Drag & Drop Reordering**

- Users should be able to **drag and drop cards** to reorder the list.
- The order should persist while the user remains on the page.

### 4. **Filtering**

- Provide a **filter input** at the top of the page.
- Users can type to filter the list **by name or symbol** (e.g., typing "eth" should show Ethereum).

### ✅ Bonus (Optional)

These are not required, but will earn extra points:

- Persist card order to **localStorage**
- Add a **dark/light mode toggle**
- Include loading and error states
- User authentication
- Unit tests

### 📦 Submission Guidelines

- Share your project via GitHub.
- Include a short **README** with:
    - Setup instructions
    - Notes on decisions or tradeoffs you made

### 🧠 What We’re Looking For

- Clean, modular, and idiomatic React + Remix code
- Strongly typed Typescript
- Clear and maintainable styling and layout
- Ability to integrate with APIs and handle async data
- UX polish: loading states, error handling, responsiveness
